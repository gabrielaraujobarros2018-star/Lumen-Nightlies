# Lumen Nightlies
Lumen Milestone M1 (or 1.0.6) delivers a system-grade GUI stack: power-aware animations, vibrant shaders, shadowed layers, safety popups, thermal and battery protection, gesture handling, debug overlays, and compositor extensions, bringing responsive, efficient visuals across desktop and mobile hardware with zero app dependence OS. Also, Big structure changes in the directory tree like shortening.

Older builds, like Lumen M2, Aim to add important missing things to avoid incompatibility or "Toy GUI" failures, Though that is unknown if it's implemented or not ¯⁠\⁠_⁠(⁠ツ⁠)⁠_⁠/⁠¯
