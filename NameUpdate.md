# Name Transition: NeoprotoOS → PalisadeOS → Lumen

This document records the evolution of the operating system’s name and the reasoning behind the final choice.

This is not marketing material. It is project history and intent.

---

## 1. NeoprotoOS (Early Experimentation)

NeoprotoOS was the original name during the earliest phase of development.

It reflected:

- experimentation  
- learning low-level fundamentals  
- prototyping without long-term structure  

The name accurately described the stage of the project: new, proto, unfinished.

As development progressed, the name stopped fitting the direction of the system.

## 2. PalisadeOS (Transitional Phase)

PalisadeOS marked a transition toward a more serious and structured system.

It represented:

- an attempt at solidity and robustness  
- a defensive, protective theme  
- a desire to sound established  

While stronger than the previous name, it carried early-project energy and thematic weight that no longer aligned with the long-term vision.

The system outgrew the name.

## 3. Lumen (Deliberate Rewrite)

The rewrite marks a clear boundary.

With it, the project adopts its final name:

**Lumen**

No suffix is baked into the name.

Lumen represents:

- clarity over complexity  
- understanding over automation  
- authorship over assistance  

The name is intentionally soft, short, and neutral. It does not explain itself or attempt to signal importance. Meaning is earned through implementation, not branding.

Lumen is the system as it is understood, not merely assembled.

---

## Philosophy Going Forward

Names follow growth.

Code is rewritten when understanding improves.

History is preserved, not erased.

NeoprotoOS and PalisadeOS remain part of the project’s lineage.

Lumen is the result.
